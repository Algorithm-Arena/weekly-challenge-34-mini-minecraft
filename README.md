# Weekly Challenge #34 - Mini Minecraft

**For this challenge, you need to implement a program that lets you move around and add blocks like in Minecraft.** The game of Minecraft is so fascinating because the concept is very simple and yet the things you can create with it have a huge amount of depth. For this challenge you can play around with building your own version.
